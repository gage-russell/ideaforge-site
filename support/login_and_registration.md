## Verify your email

After registering, you'll be taken to the email verification screen. A 6-digit verification code will be sent to your email address. Enter the code to verify your email and unlock all features.

If you don't see the email, check your spam or junk folder. The verification email is sent from <strong>DoNotReply@e.ideaforgetechnologies.com</strong>. You can tap "Resend Code" to request a new code if needed.

You can also find a reminder to verify your email in the User tab if you navigate away from the verification screen.
