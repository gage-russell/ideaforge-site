# Ideas

Capture and share ideas, then collaborate with your groups.

## If you have no ideas yet

When you navigate to Ideas from the bottom navigation and you haven't created any yet, you'll see an empty state inviting you to capture your first idea.

## Create a new idea

Tap New idea to open the editor. Give your idea a clear title and jot down the core details. When you're finished, save it to create the idea.

## View an idea

After saving, you're taken to the idea's detail page. Here you can review or edit content, start a discussion, and decide how you'd like to share it.

## Overview: Ideas list
