# Account

Use Settings to review your account details, manage security, and—if needed—delete your account. The steps below walk you through the flow end to end.

## Open Settings

From the app, tap the gear icon to open Settings. This is the central place to manage your preferences and account.

## Settings

On the Settings screen, look for the Account tile. Open it to view your account details and actions.

## Open Account

Tap Account to see information related to your profile and security. Advanced actions live here as well.

## Delete your account

At the bottom of the Account screen, there’s a section for permanent, irreversible actions. If you decide to delete your account, review the warning carefully—your data will be removed and you’ll be signed out.

## Confirm deletion

When prompted, confirm the deletion to complete the process. This cannot be undone. If you simply need a break, consider signing out instead.
