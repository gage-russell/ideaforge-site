# Privacy Policy

Effective date: December 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Ideaforge ("we", "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our app and website.

## What we collect

- Account information: name, email address, and credentials (stored securely; passwords are hashed).
- Verification data: email verification status, password reset tokens.
- User-generated content: ideas, discussions, customer segments, competitor entries, groups, and invitations.
- Preferences: chosen AI model, interests, notification settings.
- Usage data: app interactions, logs, and device details (as necessary for security and performance).
- Cookies and similar technologies on the website for essential functionality and analytics.

## How we use information

- Provide and improve core features: authentication, profiles, ideas, groups, discussions, and notifications.
- AI assistance: process your content to generate suggestions (e.g., ideas, customer segments, competitor insights). This may involve sending relevant content to third-party AI providers under strict controls.
- Security and integrity: detect, prevent, and respond to abuse or technical issues.
- Communication: send verification emails, password resets, and important service updates.

## AI processing

When you use AI features, portions of your content (e.g., idea text, context) may be transmitted to trusted AI service providers to generate results. We limit what we send to what’s necessary, and we do not permit providers to use your data to train models on our behalf.

## Sharing

We do not sell your personal data. We share information only with:

- Service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, email delivery, AI inference), bound by contractual obligations.
- Parties required by law, regulation, or legal process.
- Other users you collaborate with (e.g., members of your groups or recipients of invitations), according to your actions and settings.

## Data retention

We retain data for as long as necessary to provide the service and for legitimate business needs (e.g., security, compliance). You may request deletion of your account and associated content, subject to legal or operational constraints.

## Your choices & rights

- Access, update, or delete your information (subject to verification).
- Manage interests, AI model preferences, and notifications in the app.
- Opt out of non-essential communications.
- Depending on your location, you may have additional rights (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). To exercise rights, contact us at the address below.

## Children’s privacy

Our service is not directed to children under 13 (or a higher age as required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Security

We implement administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## International transfers

We may process and store information in countries other than your own. We apply appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers where required.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the app or website. The "last_updated" date above reflects the most recent revision.
