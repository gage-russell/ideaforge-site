# Groups

Manage collaboration through groups: create teams, invite members, and accept invites.

## If you have no groups yet

If you navigate to Groups using the bottom navigation and you haven't created any groups yet, you'll see an empty state with a prompt to create your first group.

## Create a new group

## View a group

After you submit the form, you'll be redirected to your newly created group. From here you can see group details, manage members, and start collaborating.

## Overview: Groups list

Use the back button or the bottom navigation to return to the Groups list. Your new group now appears in the list so you can quickly open it again or create another.
