## Verify your email

After registering, check your inbox for a verification email. Until you verify, some features remain limited. You can also find a reminder in the User tab.

## Find the verification email

Look for an email titled “Verify your email” in your inbox. The message is sent from <strong>DoNotReply@mg.ideaforgetechnologie.com</strong> so you know what to expect.

Tip: If you don’t see it, check your spam or junk folder, and consider searching for “Ideaforge” or the sender address above.

## Verification email sender details

If you’re unsure whether the email is legitimate, expand the sender/receiver details. You should see the sender as <strong>DoNotReply@mg.ideaforgetechnologie.com</strong> and your email address as the recipient.
