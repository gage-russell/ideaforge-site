# Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, start here. These quick checks resolve most problems.

## Didn’t receive the verification/reset email?

- Check spam/junk folders and Promotions tabs.
- Add our address to your contacts and request the email again.
- If using a corporate or school email, ensure external messages aren’t blocked.

## Can’t sign in after verifying?

- Close and reopen the app, then try again.
- Ensure you’re on the latest app version.
- Reset your password and attempt sign-in again.

## Network issues

- Use a reliable internet connection.
- If you’re on a restrictive network, try mobile data or another Wi‑Fi.
- The app requires secure HTTPS endpoints for production.
